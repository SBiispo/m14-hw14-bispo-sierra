        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a self-taught artist who has been freelancing since I was fresh out of high school in 2014. Art and creativity have always been a huge part of my life, and I’ve loved turning my passion into something tangible. I’m also a big fan of video games and all things technology, which fuels my interest in combining creativity with innovation.

          Outside of my work, I dream of traveling the world and experiencing everything it has to offer. Whether it’s exploring new places or creating something unique, I’m always inspired by the possibilities around me. For me, life is about learning, growing, and creating—whether that’s through art, design, or the adventures I hope to have in the future.

                  One of my favorite hobbies is running my Etsy store, where I bring my love for goofy, chubby animal designs to life. I create fun and unique characters and work with manufacturers to transform my ideas into tangible products. The process of designing, creating, and sharing these products with others brings me immense joy and fulfillment. It’s a way for me to combine creativity with a bit of business, all while spreading smiles with my silly creations.

        <p class="card-text">
          My ultimate career goal is to combine my love of art and my skills in graphic design with my growing interest in technology, especially coding. While I have a solid foundation in graphic design, I’m eager to improve my coding abilities so I can fully integrate these two passions.

          In the future, I hope to start my own small company that specializes in creating stunning graphics and user-friendly websites for clients. Alongside this, I want to continue building my art business, showcasing my goofy creations and unique products that bring a little joy and creativity into the world. In a perfect world I would love to be able to run my art business full-time and keep creating products. But ya girl needs money so for now it will stay a hobby, but it's a huge goal of mine as well.
